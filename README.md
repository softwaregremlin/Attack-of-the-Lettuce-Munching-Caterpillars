# Attack-of-the-Lettuce-Munching-Caterpillars
This game was originally written for the iOs and Android platforms in 2012, selling maybe 10 copies for $1 each and a few hundred free downloads.
HOWEVER it was written in the (now defunct) "Marmalade" SDK which is C/C++. I have dug up the source code and ported it to VITA homebrew - enjoy!
